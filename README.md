# AUSWeather-RainfallPrediction
This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict rainfall in the Melbourne area, Australia. Using historical weather data from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, we developed and compared multiple classification models using RandomForest and LogisticRegression algorithms.
